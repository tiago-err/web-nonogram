# A minimalist web version of the [Nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) game

A simple **proof of concept** on randomly generating _nonograms_ of multiple sizes.
I really enjoy solving _nonograms_, but had never tried making my own _nonogram_ game, so here it is!

It's a pretty simple and minimalist _React_ web application, that mostly helped me understand the steps behind the generation of a _nonogram_, along with its hints, and the use of [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to animate the transitions between each step.

It currently has a small amount of sizes, mostly because of the size of the grid on the Desktop browser.

A [demo](https://nonogram-web.vercel.app) is currently being hosted on Vercel for anyone to try out.
